# Three-Body-Problem
#### Kevin Shao, 2021 ISEF Team Canada Candidate, London Central Secondary School
## Function:
The focus of this repository is the relative and inertial numerical integrators for the general gravitational three body problem.
## Use:
The majority of the code is in Julia. It is known to work on VSCode on Windows 10. [This](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ageron/julia_notebooks/blob/master/Julia_Colab_Notebook_Template.ipynb) Google colab notebook sets up an online Julia environment that should work for any web-enabled device.

## Used Libraries:
Quadmath (For Float128)\
Distributed (For Parallel Processing)\
DistributedArrays (For Parallel Processing)\
SharedArrays (For Parallel Processing)\
DataFrames (To facilitate saving data as CSV)\
CSV (To save data as CSV)\
Plots (For making rudimentary plots)

## Data:
The raw data is included in this repository. [A Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LX6dTDEkx27fDUC6TBX98CG4ZHpKpblv?usp=sharing) was used to clean the data and generate figures.
